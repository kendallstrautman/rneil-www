github says I need to update react dom to 16.0.1

updated webpack-dev-server and webpack today. 
code compiled fine but got this invalid host/origin header
in console [WDS disconnected]
-probably something they patched -maybe the problem
they were talking about. 

added this 

    disableHostCheck: true

to the devServer webpack.config
